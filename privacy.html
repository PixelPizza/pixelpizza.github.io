      <p>The discord data we collect is user ids, channel ids, guild ids and links to images of orders.</p>
      <p>We collect this data, because we need it to identify which user ordered, cooked or delivered an order (user ids) and where to deliver that order to (guild and channel ids).</p>
      <p>Aside from the discord data we collect we also store:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your orders to be able to know what to make</li>
        <li>The date of ordering, cooking and delivering. This is mostly used for complaints if an order takes too long to make</li>
        <li>The way the order got delivered, this gets used for checking wether a new invite can be generated for an order if the old one was invalid</li>
        <li>The reason why an order was deleted, so it can be recovered if it should not have been removed.</li>
        <li>Delivery messages of deliverers for delivering the order with a custom message.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>We do not share this data with anyone except discord and our workers.</strong></p>
      <p>If you have any concerns about our bot you can contact us via <a href="mailto:pixel-pizza@outlook.com">pixel-pizza@outlook.com</a> or our <a href="https://discord.gg/MzbsFPe">support server</a>.</p>
